The code can be run in R, using the following commands:

source('CorrelationVsCovarianceSim.R')

source('CorrelationVsCovarianceSim_WithOtherMeasures.R')


Before running the code, be sure to have R installed (e.g., RStudio), and that you have the following R packages installed:
ggplot2, sapa, plyr, entropy, grid
